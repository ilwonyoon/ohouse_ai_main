# Documentation Archive

This directory collects historical planning material that is no longer part of the active workflow but may be useful for reference.

## Layout

- `root/general` – Legacy workspace-wide notes.
- `root/interactive-editor` – Archived files from the earlier interactive editor exploration.
- `ai-consultant/phase-plans` – Previous implementation plans, checklists, and progress trackers for the AI consultant project.
- `ai-consultant/reports` – Code review summaries, implementation recaps, and related reports.
- `ai-consultant/references` – Supporting references (push instructions, change logs, numbering guide).
- `ai-consultant/prd` – Earlier phase PRDs superseded by the unified plan.

All files remain read-only references; update the live docs in the project roots when making future changes.
