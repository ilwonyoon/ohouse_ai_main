        │   ├── modern_002.jpg

        │   └── ...
        ├── traditional/
        └── ... (all 20 style folders)
```

### File Naming Convention
- Format: `{style}_{number}.jpg` (e.g., `modern_001.jpg`)
- Image dimensions: 800x600px minimum (landscape)
- File size: < 200KB each
- Format: JPG for photos, PNG for illustrations if needed

### CDN Alternative (if scale requires)
If local storage becomes too large, images can be hosted on:
